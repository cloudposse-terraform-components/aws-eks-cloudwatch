# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This component installs the CloudWatch Observability chart for EKS. You may want to use this chart rather than the addon if you need to install a priority class with the CloudWatch Observability chart. The addon at this time does not support priority classes with configuration (see References for details).
usage: |-
  **Stack Level**: Regional

  For example, to install the CloudWatch Observability chart for EKS:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      eks/cloudwatch:
        vars:
          name: eks-cloudwatch
          # We need to create a priority class for the CloudWatch agent to use
          # to ensure the cloudwatch-agent and fluent-bit pods are scheduled on all nodes
          priority_class_enabled: true
  ```
